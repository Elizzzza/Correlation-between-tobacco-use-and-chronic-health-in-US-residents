# Correlation-between-tobacco-use-and-chronic-health-in-US-residents

## Aims: 
Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States. Studies on the association between tobacco use, chronic disease risk, and the oral health risk of adults could be beneficial to learning about the trend of health objectives. The objective of this study was to examine tobacco usage as a potential predictor of chronic health and oral health of the US residents and potentially study the association of chronic disease conditions, oral health, and tobacco usage in gender subgroups and race/ethnicity subgroups.

## Methods: 
This cross-sectional study analyzed population-based data from the 2020 US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) available on the CDC website. A sample of 282,071 adults was examined in the study. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between tobacco use and health exposure variables (chronic health and oral health) and interactions between tobacco use, gender subgroup, and race/ethnicity subgroups, controlling for age, gender, race/ ethnicity, income level, health insurance status, BMI, education level, and other health diagnoses.

## Results: 
Tobacco use or smoking status was significantly associated with oral health status. The odds of having good oral health status are estimated to be 42% lower for smokers compared to non-smokers, adjusting for all the other variables (95% CI: 20.7 - 57.5% lower). There is no evidence for interaction between smoking status and gender (p=0.211), but there is evidence for interaction between smoking status and race/ ethnicity group (p=0.0478). However, there is no evidence that tobacco use or smoking status was significantly associated with chronic health status. The odds of having good chronic health status are estimated to be 28.3% lower for smokers compared to non-smokers, adjusting for all the other variables (95% CI: 49.1% lower - 1.1% higher). There is no evidence for interaction between smoking status and race/ ethnicity group (p=0.702), but there is evidence for interaction between smoking status and gender (p=0.0000138).

## Conclusions: 
Tobacco use is correlated with worsened oral health status among US residents. However, tobacco use is not correlated with chronic health status with the selected health variables and indicators used in the study.
